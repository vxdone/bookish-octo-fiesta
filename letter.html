  <p> it's been quite awhile since we last talked, so let's just have a chat. </p>
  <p> i hope you're faring well in... michigan? california? i honestly don't know where you are at the moment lol. hopefully it isn't somewhere too banal for your liking. </p>
  <p> i haven't been the most active onine (which you probably have noticed) lately. i've been doing some reflecting and musing over my life choices this summer, so that's why i've been i/a. </p>
  <p> i've come to realize that you're one of the few who <i> truly </i> care about me. you've been there for me during times of dispair, and i'm so grateful for that. in fact, you may have been the only one who i relied on. </p>
  <p> so, thank you. truly. i miss you terribly over here. it doesn't really feel the same anymore. i guess i got too used to your comforting presence. </p>
  <p> at the time you're reading this, i'm guessing you haven't started school yet. because, let's be honest, who starts school in early august? (ok maybe boarding schools, but i don't think you're attending one... right???). hope the school environment isn't too stressful and discomforting. i know new schools can be a bit daunting at times. </p>
  <p> i'm a bit scared to start my school year, but i know i have great friends like you that i can rely on. i'll try my best to be more active online, but life may get in the way lol. </p>
  <p> anyways! enough about me. how are you actually doing? how's the weather? is it snowing right now (i never actually experienced snow, so i consider you a lucky person)? </p>
  <p> wait - how's your birthday going? i am just now realizing i have rambled on for about 2/3 of this letter and haven't really mentioned your birthday at all (oopsies). forgive me. have you eaten cake? gotten together with family? recieved any cool presents? </p>
  <p> maybe one day we'll meet up again and celebrate your birthday in person. i look forward to that day. it was fun hanging out with you that one rainy day during 8th grade. (remember when my mom said something along the lines of kidnapping u when she first saw you? LOL) </p>
  <p> ok ok, i'll stop rambling now. go ahead and enjoy your birthday. you deserve it. if you need anything, shoot me a message. i'll try my best to respond.  </p>
  <p> cheers to another year of this friendship, </p>
